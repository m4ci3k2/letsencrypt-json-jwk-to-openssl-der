(Re)construct OpenSSL-compatible RSA public and private keys from integer RSA parameters

;tldr

The letsencrypt client requires root. letsencrypt-nosudo doesn't. letsencrypt generates
and stores cryptographic keys in JSON, but letsencrypt-nosudo uses OpenSSL PEM files instead.
These scripts create standard DER-encoded OpenSSL-compatible RSA public and private keys
from the letsencrypt generated ones (which can easily be converted to PEM).


Background

Let's Encrypt (https://letsencrypt.org/) is a really cool project that provides 100% free
SSL certificates and infrastructure around renewing and revoking those certificates.

Unfortunately, their default client
https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
requires that you run it as root so it can temporarily start a web server on a privileged
port (80 or 443). This is necessary to verify that you actually control the domain for
which you've requested a certificate.

As a participant in the letsencrypt beta, I ran the letsencrypt client in a VM as root
to obtain my first free SSL certificate. Now that letsencrypt is publicly available,
I wanted a better solution that I would feel comfortable running on additional hosts.

letsencrypt-nosudo
https://github.com/diafygi/letsencrypt-nosudo/
solves this problem by providing scripts that break up the process so that you
need only run a single command as root.

The problem I ran into was that letsencrypt-nosudo expects you to have a letsencrypt RSA
certificate and private key in PEM format.

I could have generated a new one, but I wasn't sure how letsencrypt would handle a
different user trying to operate on a domain for which it had already signed a certificate.

I knew the letsencrypt client stored some metadata on my system when I ran it. Upon
further investigation, I discovered JSON files under
/etc/letsencrypt/accounts/

Looking at those JSON files, I saw that they contained what looked like RSA parameters.
After several Internet searches, I was surprised that there didn't seem to be a good way
to construct OpenSSL-compatible files directly from the RSA parameters. The format of
PEM and DER files was always a bit of a mystery to me, so I decided that writing some
scripts to do this would be a good learning experience. It definitely was.


How to use

1.  Make sure you are on a compatible system.
        You need Python (I used Python 2.7.10) and openssl (I used OpenSSL 1.0.2d-fips 9 Jul 2015)
        python >= 2.6.x (3.x probably works, but I haven't tested)
        openssl >= 1.0.x (maybe earlier versions work)
2.  Install dependencies
        pip install PyASN1
3.  Find your private_key.json and regr.json files in /etc/letsencrypt/accounts/

Reconstruct public key:
4.  Run Python script:
        python decode_public_key_json.py < regr.json > user.pub.der
5.  Convert newly constructed DER file to PEM:
        openssl rsa -pubin -inform DER -in user.pub.der -outform PEM -out user.pub.pem

Reconstruct private key:
6.  Run Python script:
        python decode_private_key_json.py < private_key.json > user.key.der
7.  Convert newly constructed DER file to PEM:
        openssl rsa -inform DER -in user.key.der -outform PEM -out user.key.pem

Reconstruct public key (alternative method):
    As it turns out, all the parameters required for the public key are stored in the
    private key too.
        openssl rsa -in user.key.pem -pubout user.pub.pem

8.  Move files into place.
    letsencrypt-nosudo expects specific filenames because it generates commands
    for you to copy and paste:
        mv user.pub.pem user.pub
        mv user.key.pem user.key

9.  Run letsencrypt-nosudo!
10. Profit.


Educational component

This code might be interesting to anyone interested in cryptography or networking
who knows how to use PEM/DER files but for whom their contents may be a mystery.

Here are some things I learned along the way:

PEM is a container format. It can contain pretty much anything, but it primarily used for
cryptographic keys. PEM files can be concatenated. In fact, many programs expect you to
do this (e.g. to configure a certificate chain). PEM files are designed to be somewhat
human readable (for easy pasting into files and emails):

$ openssl genrsa 1024 > sample-rsa-key.pem
$ cat sample-rsa-key.pem

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

PEM files consist of one or more labeled sections.
-----BEGIN ...-----
-----END ...-----
The section contains a base64-encoded DER-encoded object.

DER is a binary format that can contain anything (more on that in a minute).

There are several standards for cryptographic formats
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS

Unencrypted RSA public and private keys fall under PKCS1
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_1
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447

RSA uses the theorem that finding the prime factors of a large number
is difficult for today's computers to ensure security. There are several
parameters involved:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-2

These parameters, (e.g. n, e, p, q) are split across the public and private keys.
Read the RFC for more information.

The parameters are encoded into the public and private keys using DER.

OpenSSL can convert between PEM and DER encodings:
$ openssl rsa -inform PEM -in sample-rsa-key.pem -outform DER -out sample-rsa-key.der
$ cat sample-rsa-key.der
[omitted for clarity]

A bit less readable. Let's look at the file as hex instead:
$ xxd -p sample-rsa-key.der

All DER files are valid BER. DER, CER, and BER are formats of ASN.1 encoding.
ASN.1 is a binary format used for encoding data to be transmitted over the wire.
ASN.1 can be used to encode integers, strings, and other data types in a structured
hierarchy. Think of it as a binary version of XML.

OpenSSL can print out ASN.1 data in a more human readable way:
$ openssl asn1parse -inform DER -in sample-rsa-key.der -i
    0:d=0  hl=4 l= 604 cons: SEQUENCE          
    4:d=1  hl=2 l=   1 prim:  INTEGER           :00
    7:d=1  hl=3 l= 129 prim:  INTEGER           :D6F7CBB7E77D02648A287C0B72EEDB9...
  139:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim:  INTEGER           :010001
  144:d=1  hl=3 l= 128 prim:  INTEGER           :3F3E5DD7F829E617503242F45757009...
  275:d=1  hl=2 l=  65 prim:  INTEGER           :F3EEAA4794A1C28D7918DC0AECF7782...
  342:d=1  hl=2 l=  65 prim:  INTEGER           :E19A4E2BE8CC5B98B5C3E94A8B2A1FE...
  409:d=1  hl=2 l=  65 prim:  INTEGER           :93823CE88261FB736FCA6FAE0FB46AB...
  476:d=1  hl=2 l=  64 prim:  INTEGER           :3E77FEBB53DBFA64FFB7BECA805C6AB...
  542:d=1  hl=2 l=  64 prim:  INTEGER           :5A5DD0A42BFCEB69D6583C09D2BF4E8...

Here's an example of the corresponding public key to make the structured aspect more apparent:
$ openssl rsa -inform DER -in sample-rsa-key.der -pubout -outform DER -out sample-rsa-key.pub.der
$ openssl asn1parse -inform DER -in sample-rsa-key.pub.der -i
    0:d=0  hl=3 l= 159 cons: SEQUENCE          
    3:d=1  hl=2 l=  13 cons:  SEQUENCE          
    5:d=2  hl=2 l=   9 prim:   OBJECT            :rsaEncryption
   16:d=2  hl=2 l=   0 prim:   NULL              
   18:d=1  hl=3 l= 141 prim:  BIT STRING

d=depth, increased by new scope of SET or SEQUENCE
hl=header length for tag + octets
l=length in octets

See that bit string? It's actually another DER-encoded object:
$ openssl asn1parse -inform DER -in sample-rsa-key.pub.der -i -strparse 18
    0:d=0  hl=3 l= 137 cons: SEQUENCE          
    3:d=1  hl=3 l= 129 prim:  INTEGER           :D6F7CBB7E77D02648A287C0B72EEDB9...
  135:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim:  INTEGER           :010001

The -strparse <n> argument starts the parsing at an offset of 18 bytes.
https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/apps/asn1parse.html


ASN.1 encoding is fairly straightforward. This Wikipedia page has the details:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#BER_encoding

Let's dissect the bits in a public key. If you compare the hex dump of the DER-encoded key:
$ xxd -p sample-rsa-key2.pub.der
to the readable OpenSSL dump:
$ openssl rsa -inform DER -in sample-rsa-key2.pub.der -noout -text
you'll see that the DER file is encoded like this:

00000000: 3082 0222 300d 0609 2a86 4886 f70d 0101
00000010: 0105 0003 8202 0f00 3082 020a 0282 0201
... modulus bits ...
02 03
... exponent bits ...

Decoding byte by byte according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#BER_encoding:

30: SEQUENCE type
82: length (long form) consists of next two octets
02 22: length is 0x0222 == 546 octets

contents of top level sequence:
30: SEQUENCE type
0d: length (short form, first bit ignored) is 0x0d == 13 octets

contents of 2nd level sequence:
06: OBJECT type
09: length (short form, first bit ignored) is 0x09 == 9 octets

2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 01 01
(to be explained later)

05: NULL type
00: length (short form, first bit ignored) is 0x00 = 0 octets

(end 2nd level sequence because we've read 13 octets)

03: BIT STRING type
82: length (long form) consists of next two octets
02 0f: length is 527 octets

00?

bit string happens to be another BER-encoded object:
30: SEQUENCE type
82: length (long form) consists of next two octets
02 0a: length is 0x020a == 522 octets
02: INTEGER type
82: length (long form) consists of next two octets
02 01: length is 0x0201 == 513 octets
... modulus bits ...

02: INTEGER type
03: length (short form, first bit ignored) is 0x03 == 3 bits
... exponent bits ...


Remember that magic 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 01 01 sequence?
It's the Object ID 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1 that represents RSA encryption.
Here's the explanation for how that conversion works:
http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/29115/how-is-oid-2a-86-48-86-f7-0d-parsed-as-1-2-840-113549


This page shows how an RSA private key is encoded (it's actually simpler than the public key):
http://etherhack.co.uk/asymmetric/docs/rsa_key_breakdown.html

The PyASN1 Python module
http://pyasn1.sourceforge.net/codecs.html
can encode and decode PyASN1 in an object oriented way, so I used it to do the heavy lifting.


Future work

Upon further research, the JSON format letsencrypt uses is actually a draft standard:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517
JSON Web Key (JWK) seems much cleaner than the binary formats currently used by OpenSSL
so hopefully it will become more widely used.

These scripts could be generalized to operate on JWK JSON files instead of just the
letsencrypt JSON files.
